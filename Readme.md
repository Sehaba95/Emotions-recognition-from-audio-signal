###Emotion Recognition From Audio Signal
This is my solution of Emotion Recognition From Audio Signal from Surrey Audio-Visual Expressed Emotion (SAVEE) Database.

The SAVEE database was recorded from four native English male speakers (identified as DC, JE, JK, KL), postgraduate students and researchers at the University of Surrey.

The database consists of recordings from 4 male actors in 7 different emotions, 480 British English utterances in total.

#The different emotions are:
